Despite 2022 being one of the harder macroeconomic years in recent memory,and with some of our own operating challenges to boot, we still found a way to grow demand (on top ofthe unprecedented growth we experienced in the first half of the pandemic). We innovated in our largestbusinesses to meaningfully improve customer experience short and long term. And, we made importantadjustments in our investment decisions and the way in which we’ll invent moving forward, while stillpreserving the long-term investments that we believe can change the future of Amazon for customers,\\nshareholders, and employees.\\nWhile there were an unusual number of simultaneous challenges this past year, the reality is that if you\\noperate in large, dynamic, global market segments with many capable and well-funded competitors (theconditions in which Amazon operates all of its businesses), conditions rarely stay stagnant for long.\\nIn the 25 years I’ve been at Amazon, there has been constant change, much of which we’ve initiated ourselves.\\nWhen I joined Amazon in 1997, we had booked $15M in revenue in 1996, were a books-only retailer, didnot have a third-party marketplace, and only shipped to addresses in the US. Today, Amazon sells nearly everyphysical and digital retail item you can imagine, with a vibrant third-party seller ecosystem that accountsfor 60% of our unit sales, and reaches customers in virtually every country around the world. Similarly,building a business around a set of technology infrastructure services in the cloud was not obvious in 2003when we started pursuing AWS, and still wasn’t when we launched our first services in 2006. Having virtuallyevery book at your fingertips in 60 seconds, and then being able to store and retrieve them on a lightweightdigital reader was not “a thing”yet when we launched Kindle in 2007, nor was a voice-driven personal assistantlike Alexa (launched in 2014) that you could use to access entertainment, control your smart home, shop,and retrieve all sorts of information.\\nThere have also been times when macroeconomic conditions or operating inefficiencies have presented us\\nwith new challenges. For instance, in the 2001 dot-com crash, we had to secure letters of credit to buyinventory for the holidays, streamline costs to deliver better profitability for the business, yet still prioritizedthe long-term customer experience and business we were trying to build (if you remember, we actuallylowered prices in most of our categories during that tenuous 2001 period). Y ou saw this sort of balancingagain in 2008-2009 as we endured the recession provoked by the mortgage-backed securities financial crisis.We took several actions to manage the cost structure and efficiency of our Stores business, but we alsobalanced this streamlining with investment in customer experiences that we believed could be substantialfuture businesses with strong returns for shareholders. In 2008, AWS was still a fairly small, fledgling business.We knew we were on to something, but it still required substantial capital investment. There were voicesinside and outside of the company questioning why Amazon (known mostly as an online retailer then) wouldbe investing so much in cloud computing. But, we knew we were inventing something special that couldcreate a lot of value for customers and Amazon in the future. We had a head start on potential competitors;and if anything, we wanted to accelerate our pace of innovation. We made the long-term decision tocontinue investing in AWS. Fifteen years later, AWS is now an $85B annual revenue run rate business, withstrong profitability, that has transformed how customers from start-ups to multinational companies to publicsector organizations manage their technology infrastructure. Amazon would be a different company ifwe’d slowed investment in AWS during that 2008-2009 period.\\nChange is always around the corner. Sometimes, you proactively invite it in, and sometimes it just comes\\na-knocking. But, when you see it’s coming, you have to embrace it. And, the companies that do this well overa long period of time usually succeed. I’m optimistic about our future prospects because I like the way ourteam is responding to the changes we see in front of us.', metadata={'source': 'https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2023/ar/2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='Over the last several months, we took a deep look across the company, business by business , invention by\\ninvention, and asked ourselves whether we had conviction about each initiative’s long-term potential to driveenough revenue, operating income, free cash flow, and return on invested capital. In some cases, it led to usshuttering certain businesses. For instance, we stopped pursuing physical store concepts like our Bookstoresand 4 Star stores, closed our Amazon Fabric and Amazon Care efforts, and moved on from some newerdevices where we didn’t see a path to meaningful returns. In other cases, we looked at some programs thatweren’t producing the returns we’d hoped (e.g. free shipping for all online grocery orders over $35) andamended them. We also reprioritized where to spend our resources, which ultimately led to the hard decisionto eliminate 27,000 corporate roles. There are a number of other changes that we’ve made over the lastseveral months to streamline our overall costs, and like most leadership teams, we’ll continue to evaluatewhat we’re seeing in our business and proceed adaptively.\\nWe also looked hard at how we were working together as a team and asked our corporate employees to come\\nback to the office at least three days a week , beginning in May. During the pandemic, our employees rallied to\\nget work done from home and did everything possible to keep up with the unexpected circumstances thatpresented themselves. It was impressive and I’m proud of the way our collective team came together toovercome unprecedented challenges for our customers, communities, and business. But, we don’t think it’s thebest long-term approach. We’ve become convinced that collaborating and inventing is easier and moreeffective when we’re working together and learning from one another in person. The energy and riffing onone another’s ideas happen more freely, and many of the best Amazon inventions have had their breakthroughmoments from people staying behind after a meeting and working through ideas on a whiteboard, orcontinuing the conversation on the walk back from a meeting, or just popping by a teammate’s office laterthat day with another thought. Invention is often messy. It wanders and meanders and marinates.Serendipitous interactions help it, and there are more of those in-person than virtually. It’s also significantlyeasier to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture when we’re in the office together most of thetime and surrounded by our colleagues. Innovation and our unique culture have been incredibly importantin our first 29 years as a company, and I expect it will be comparably so in the next 29.\\nA critical challenge we’ve continued to tackle is the rising cost to serve in our Stores fulfillment network (i.e.\\nthe cost to get a product from Amazon to a customer)—and we’ve made several changes that we believe will\\nmeaningfully improve our fulfillment costs and speed of delivery .\\nDuring the early part of the pandemic, with many physical stores shut down, our consumer business grew\\nat an extraordinary clip, with annual revenue increasing from $245B in 2019 to $434B in 2022. This meant thatwe had to double the fulfillment center footprint that we’d built over the prior 25 years and substantiallyaccelerate building a last-mile transportation network that’s now the size of UPS (along with a new sortationcenter network to assist with efficiency and speed when items needed to traverse long distances)—all in thespan of about two years. This was no easy feat, and hundreds of thousands of Amazonians worked very hardto make this happen. However, not surprisingly, with that rate and scale of change, there was a lot ofoptimization needed to yield the intended productivity. Over the last several months, we’ve scrutinized everyprocess path in our fulfillment centers and transportation network and redesigned scores of processes andmechanisms, resulting in steady productivity gains and cost reductions over the last few quarters. There’smore work to do, but we’re pleased with our trajectory and the meaningful upside in front of us.\\nWe also took this occasion to make larger structural changes that set us up better to deliver lower costs and\\nfaster speed for many years to come. A good example was reevaluating how our US fulfillment network wasorganized. Until recently, Amazon operated one national US fulfillment network that distributed inventoryfrom fulfillment centers spread across the entire country. If a local fulfillment center didn’t have the product acustomer ordered, we’d end up shipping it from other parts of the country, costing us more and increasingdelivery times. This challenge became more pronounced as our fulfillment network expanded to hundreds ofadditional nodes over the last few years, distributing inventory across more locations and increasing the\\ncomplexity of connecting the fulfillment center and delivery station nodes efficiently. Last year, we startedrearchitecting our inventory placement strategy and leveraging our larger fulfillment center footprint to movefrom a national fulfillment network to a regionalized network model. We made significant internal changes(e.g. placement and logistics software, processes, physical operations) to create eight interconnected regions insmaller geographic areas. Each of these regions has broad, relevant selection to operate in a largely self-sufficient way, while still being able to ship nationally when necessary. Some of the most meaningful and hard', metadata={'source': 'https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2023/ar/2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='work came from optimizing the connections between this large amount of infrastructure. We also continue\\nto improve our advanced machine learning algorithms to better predict what customers in various parts of thecountry will need so that we have the right inventory in the right regions at the right time. We’ve recentlycompleted this regional roll out and like the early results. Shorter travel distances mean lower cost to serve,less impact on the environment, and customers getting their orders faster. On the latter, we’re excited aboutseeing more next day and same-day deliveries, and we’re on track to have our fastest Prime delivery speedsever in 2023. Overall, we remain confident about our plans to lower costs, reduce delivery times, and build a\\nmeaningfully larger retail business with healthy operating margins.\\nAWS has an $85B annualized revenue run rate, is still early in its adoption curve, but at a juncture where it’s\\ncritical to stay focused on what matters most to customers over the long-haul . Despite growing 29% year-over-\\nyear (“Y oY”) in 2022 on a $62B revenue base, AWS faces short-term headwinds right now as companiesare being more cautious in spending given the challenging, current macroeconomic conditions. While somecompanies might obsess over how they could extract as much money from customers as possible in these tighttimes, it’s neither what customers want nor best for customers in the long term, so we’re taking a differenttack. One of the many advantages of AWS and cloud computing is that when your business grows, you canseamlessly scale up; and conversely, if your business contracts, you can choose to give us back that capacityand cease paying for it. This elasticity is unique to the cloud, and doesn’t exist when you’ve already madeexpensive capital investments in your own on-premises datacenters, servers, and networking gear. In AWS,like all our businesses, we’re not trying to optimize for any one quarter or year. We’re trying to build customerrelationships (and a business) that outlast all of us; and as a result, our AWS sales and support teams arespending much of their time helping customers optimize their AWS spend so they can better weather thisuncertain economy. Many of these AWS customers tell us that they’re not cost-cutting as much as cost-optimizing so they can take their resources and apply them to emerging and inventive new customerexperiences they’re planning. Customers have appreciated this customer-focused, long-term approach, andwe think it’ll bode well for both customers and AWS.\\nWhile these short-term headwinds soften our growth rate, we like a lot of the fundamentals that we’re seeing\\nin AWS. Our new customer pipeline is robust, as are our active migrations. Many companies usediscontinuous periods like this to step back and determine what they strategically want to change, and wefind an increasing number of enterprises opting out of managing their own infrastructure, and preferring tomove to AWS to enjoy the agility, innovation, cost-efficiency, and security benefits. And most importantlyfor customers, AWS continues to deliver new capabilities rapidly (over 3,300 new features and services launchedin 2022), and invest in long-term inventions that change what’s possible.\\nChip development is a good example. In last year’s letter, I mentioned the investment we were making in our\\ngeneral-purpose CPU processors named Graviton. Graviton2-based compute instances deliver up to 40%better price-performance than the comparable latest generation x86-based instances; and in 2022, we deliveredour Graviton3 chips, providing 25% better performance than the Graviton2 processors. Further, as machinelearning adoption has continued to accelerate, customers have yearned for lower-cost GPUs (the chipsmost commonly used for machine learning). AWS started investing years ago in these specialized chips formachine learning training and inference (inferences are the predictions or answers that a machine learningmodel provides). We delivered our first training chip in 2022 (“Trainium”); and for the most commonmachine learning models, Trainium-based instances are up to 140% faster than GPU-based instances at upto 70% lower cost. Most companies are still in the training stage, but as they develop models that graduate tolarge-scale production, they’ll find that most of the cost is in inference because models are trainedperiodically whereas inferences are happening all the time as their associated application is being exercised.We launched our first inference chips (“Inferentia”) in 2019, and they have saved companies like Amazon overa hundred million dollars in capital expense already. Our Inferentia2 chip, which just launched, offers upto four times higher throughput and ten times lower latency than our first Inferentia processor. With theenormous upcoming growth in machine learning, customers will be able to get a lot more done with AWS’straining and inference chips at a significantly lower cost. We’re not close to being done innovating here,and this long-term investment should prove fruitful for both customers and AWS. AWS is still in the earlystages of its evolution, and has a chance for unusual growth in the next decade.\\nSimilarly high potential, Amazon’s Advertising business is uniquely effective for brands, which is part of why it\\ncontinues to grow at a brisk clip . Akin to physical retailers’ advertising businesses selling shelf space, end-\\ncaps, and placement in their circulars, our sponsored products and brands offerings have been an integral part', metadata={'source': 'https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2023/ar/2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='of the Amazon shopping experience for more than a decade. However, unlike physical retailers, Amazon\\ncan tailor these sponsored products to be relevant to what customers are searching for given what we knowabout shopping behaviors and our very deep investment in machine learning algorithms. This leads toadvertising that’s more useful for customers; and as a result, performs better for brands. This is part of whyour Advertising revenue has continued to grow rapidly (23% Y oY in Q4 2022, 25% Y oY overall for 2022on a $31B revenue base), even as most large advertising-focused businesses’ growth have slowed over the lastseveral quarters.\\nWe strive to be the best place for advertisers to build their brands. We have near and long-term opportunities\\nthat will help us achieve that mission. We’re continuing to make large investments in machine learning tokeep honing our advertising selection algorithms. For the past couple of years, we’ve invested in buildingcomprehensive, flexible, and durable planning and measurement solutions, giving marketers greater insightinto advertising effectiveness. An example is Amazon Marketing Cloud (“AMC”). AMC is a “clean room”(i.e. secure digital environment) in which advertisers can run custom audience and campaign analyticsacross a range of first and third-party inputs, in a privacy-safe manner, to generate advertising and businessinsights to inform their broader marketing and sales strategies. The Advertising and AWS teams havecollaborated to enable companies to store their data in AWS, operate securely in AMC with Amazon andother third-party data sources, perform analytics in AWS, and have the option to activate advertising onAmazon or third-party publishers through the Amazon Demand-Side Platform. Customers really like thisconcerted capability. We also see future opportunity to thoughtfully integrate advertising into our video,live sports, audio, and grocery products. We’ll continue to work hard to help brands uniquely engage withthe right audience, and grow this part of our business.\\nWhile it’s tempting in turbulent times only to focus on your existing large businesses, to build a sustainable,\\nlong-lasting, growing company that helps customers across a large number of dimensions, you can’t stop\\ninventing and working on long-term customer experiences that can meaningfully impact customers andyour company.\\nWhen we look at new investment opportunities, we ask ourselves a few questions:\\n◦If we were successful, could it be big and have a reasonable return on invested capital?\\n◦Is the opportunity being well-served today?\\n◦Do we have a differentiated approach?\\n◦And, do we have competence in that area? And if not, can we acquire it quickly?\\nIf we like the answers to those questions, then we’ll invest. This process has led to some expansions that\\nseem straightforward, and others that some folks might not have initially guessed.\\nThe earliest example is when we chose to expand from just selling Books , to adding categories like Music,\\nVideo, Electronics, and Toys. Back then (1998-1999), it wasn’t universally applauded, but in retrospect, itseems fairly obvious.\\nThe same could be said for our international Stores expansion . In 2022, our international consumer segment\\ndrove $118B of revenue. In our larger, established international consumer businesses, we’re big enough tobe impacted by the slowing macroeconomic conditions; however, the growth in 2019-2021 on a large base wasremarkable—30% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) in the UK, 26% in Germany, and 21% inJapan (excluding the impact of FX). Over the past several years, we’ve invested in new internationalgeographies, including India, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, various European countries, the Middle East, andparts of Africa. These new countries take a certain amount of fixed investment to get started and to scale, butwe like the trajectory they’re on, and their growth patterns resemble what we’ve seen in North Americaand our established international geographies. Emerging countries sometimes lack some of the infrastructureand services that our business relies on (e.g. payment methods, transportation services, and internet/telecom infrastructure). To solve these challenges, we continue to work with various partners to deliversolutions for customers. Ultimately, we believe that this investment in serving a broader geographical footprintwill allow us to help more customers across the world, as well as build a larger free cash flow-generatingconsumer business.', metadata={'source': 'https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2023/ar/2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='Beyond geographic expansion, we’ve been working to expand our customer offerings across some large,\\nunique product retail market segments. Grocery is an $800B market segment in the US alone, with the average\\nhousehold shopping three to four times per week. Amazon has built a somewhat unusual, but significantgrocery business over nearly 20 years. Similar to how other mass merchants entered the grocery space in the1980s, we began by adding products typically found in supermarket aisles that don’t require temperaturecontrol such as paper products, canned and boxed food, candy and snacks, pet care, health and personal care,and beauty. However, we offer more than three million items compared to a typical supermarket’s 30K forthe same categories. To date, we’ve also focused on larger pack sizes, given the current cost to serve onlinedelivery. While we’re pleased with the size and growth of our grocery business, we aspire to serve more ofour customers’ grocery needs than we do today. To do so, we need a broader physical store footprint given thatmost of the grocery shopping still happens in physical venues. Whole Foods Market pioneered the naturaland organic specialty grocery store concept 40 years ago. Today, it’s a large and growing business that continuesto raise the bar for healthy and sustainable food. Over the past year, we’ve continued to invest in thebusiness while also making changes to drive better profitability. Whole Foods is on an encouraging path,but to have a larger impact on physical grocery, we must find a mass grocery format that we believe is worthexpanding broadly. Amazon Fresh is the brand we’ve been experimenting with for a few years, and we’reworking hard to identify and build the right mass grocery format for Amazon scale. Grocery is a big growthopportunity for Amazon.\\nAmazon Business is another example of an investment where our ecommerce and logistics capabilities\\nposition us well to pursue this large market segment. Amazon Business allows businesses, municipalities,and organizations to procure products like office supplies and other bulk items easily and at great savings.While some areas of the economy have struggled over the past few years, Amazon Business has thrived. Why?Because the team has translated what it means to deliver selection, value, and convenience into a businessprocurement setting, constantly listening to and learning from customers, and innovating on their behalf.Some people have never heard of Amazon Business, but, our business customers love it. Amazon Businesslaunched in 2015 and today drives roughly $35B in annualized gross sales. More than six million activecustomers, including 96 of the global Fortune 100 companies, are enjoying Amazon Business’ one-stopshopping, real-time analytics, and broad selection on hundreds of millions of business supplies. We believethat we’ve only scratched the surface of what’s possible to date, and plan to keep building the features ourbusiness customers tell us they need and want.\\nWhile many brands and merchants successfully sell their products on Amazon’s marketplace, there are also\\na large number of brands and sellers who have launched their own direct-to-consumer websites. One of thechallenges for these merchants is driving conversion from views to purchases. We invented Buy with Prime\\nto help with this challenge. Buy with Prime allows third-party brands and sellers to offer their products ontheir own websites to our large Amazon Prime membership, and offer those customers fast, free Prime shippingand seamless checkout with their Amazon account. Buy with Prime provides merchants several additionalbenefits, including Amazon handling the product storage, picking, packing, delivery, payment, and anyreturns, all through Amazon Pay and Fulfillment by Amazon. Buy with Prime has recently been madeavailable to all US merchants; and so far, Buy with Prime has increased shopper conversion on third-partyshopping sites by 25% on average. Merchants are excited about converting more sales and fulfilling theseshipments more easily, Prime members love that they can use their Prime benefits on more destinations,and Buy with Prime allows us to improve the shopping experience across more of the web.\\nExpanding internationally, pursuing large retail market segments that are still nascent for Amazon, and\\nusing our unique assets to help merchants sell more effectively on their own websites are somewhat naturalextensions for us. There are also a few investments we’re making that are further from our core businesses, butwhere we see unique opportunity. In 2003, AWS would have been a classic example. In 2023, AmazonHealthcare and Kuiper are potential analogues.\\nOur initial efforts in Healthcare began with pharmacy, which felt less like a major departure from ecommerce.\\nFor years, Amazon customers had asked us when we’d offer them an online pharmacy as their frustrationsmounted with current providers. Launched in 2020, Amazon Pharmacy is a full-service, online pharmacy thatoffers transparent pricing, easy refills, and savings for Prime members. The business is growing quickly,and continues to innovate. An example is Amazon Pharmacy’s recent launch of RxPass, which for a $5 per', metadata={'source': 'https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2023/ar/2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='month flat fee, enables Prime members to get as many of the eligible prescription medications as they need\\nfor dozens of common conditions, like high blood pressure, acid reflux, and anxiety. However, our customershave continued to express a strong desire for Amazon to provide a better alternative to the inefficient andunsatisfying broader healthcare experience. We decided to start with primary care as it’s a prevalent first stopin the patient journey. We evaluated and studied the existing landscape extensively, including some early\\nAmazon experiments like Amazon Care. During this process, we identified One Medical’s patient-focusedexperience as an excellent foundation upon which to build our future business; and in July 2022, we announcedour acquisition of One Medical. There are several elements that customers love about One Medical. It hasa fantastic digital app that makes it easy for patients to discuss issues with a medical practitioner via chat orvideo conference. If a physical visit is required, One Medical has offices in cities across the US wherepatients can book same or next day appointments. One Medical has relationships with specialty physiciansin each of its cities and works closely with local hospital systems to make seeing specialists easy, so OneMedical members can quickly access these resources when needed. Going forward, we strongly believethat One Medical and Amazon will continue to innovate together to change what primary care will look likefor customers.\\nKuiper is another example of Amazon innovating for customers over the long term in an area where there’s\\nhigh customer need. Our vision for Kuiper is to create a low-Earth orbit satellite system to deliver high-qualitybroadband internet service to places around the world that don’t currently have it. There are hundreds ofmillions of households and businesses who don’t have reliable access to the internet. Imagine what they’ll beable to do with reliable connectivity, from people taking online education courses, using financial services,starting their own businesses, doing their shopping, enjoying entertainment, to businesses and governmentsimproving their coverage, efficiency, and operations. Kuiper will deliver not only accessibility, butaffordability. Our teams have developed low-cost antennas (i.e. customer terminals) that will lower thebarriers to access. We recently unveiled the new terminals that will communicate with the satellites passingoverhead, and we expect to be able to produce our standard residential version for less than $400 each. They’resmall: 11 inches square, 1 inch thick, and weigh less than 5 pounds without their mounting bracket, butthey deliver speeds up to 400 megabits per second. And they’re powered by Amazon-designed baseband chips.We’re preparing to launch two prototype satellites to test the entire end-to-end communications networkthis year, and plan to be in beta with commercial customers in 2024. The customer reaction to what we’veshared thus far about Kuiper has been very positive, and we believe Kuiper represents a very large potentialopportunity for Amazon. It also shares several similarities to AWS in that it’s capital intensive at the start,but has a large prospective consumer, enterprise, and government customer base, significant revenue andoperating profit potential, and relatively few companies with the technical and inventive aptitude, as well asthe investment hypothesis to go after it.\\nOne final investment area that I’ll mention, that’s core to setting Amazon up to invent in every area of our\\nbusiness for many decades to come, and where we’re investing heavily is Large Language Models (“LLMs”)\\nand Generative AI . Machine learning has been a technology with high promise for several decades, but it’s\\nonly been the last five to ten years that it’s started to be used more pervasively by companies. This shift wasdriven by several factors, including access to higher volumes of compute capacity at lower prices than was everavailable. Amazon has been using machine learning extensively for 25 years, employing it in everythingfrom personalized ecommerce recommendations, to fulfillment center pick paths, to drones for Prime Air,to Alexa, to the many machine learning services AWS offers (where AWS has the broadest machine learningfunctionality and customer base of any cloud provider). More recently, a newer form of machine learning,called Generative AI, has burst onto the scene and promises to significantly accelerate machine learningadoption. Generative AI is based on very Large Language Models (trained on up to hundreds of billionsof parameters, and growing), across expansive datasets, and has radically general and broad recall andlearning capabilities. We have been working on our own LLMs for a while now, believe it will transform andimprove virtually every customer experience, and will continue to invest substantially in these modelsacross all of our consumer, seller, brand, and creator experiences. Additionally, as we’ve done for years inAWS, we’re democratizing this technology so companies of all sizes can leverage Generative AI. AWS isoffering the most price-performant machine learning chips in Trainium and Inferentia so small and largecompanies can afford to train and run their LLMs in production. We enable companies to choose fromvarious LLMs and build applications with all of the AWS security, privacy and other features that customersare accustomed to using. And, we’re delivering applications like AWS’s CodeWhisperer, which revolutionizes', metadata={'source': 'https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2023/ar/2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content='developer productivity by generating code suggestions in real time. I could write an entire letter on LLMs\\nand Generative AI as I think they will be that transformative, but I’ll leave that for a future letter. Let’s justsay that LLMs and Generative AI are going to be a big deal for customers, our shareholders, and Amazon.\\nSo, in closing, I’m optimistic that we’ll emerge from this challenging macroeconomic time in a stronger\\nposition than when we entered it. There are several reasons for it and I’ve mentioned many of them above.But, there are two relatively simple statistics that underline our immense future opportunity. While we have aconsumer business that’s $434B in 2022, the vast majority of total market segment share in global retailstill resides in physical stores (roughly 80%). And, it’s a similar story for Global IT spending, where we haveAWS revenue of $80B in 2022, with about 90% of Global IT spending still on-premises and yet to migrateto the cloud. As these equations steadily flip—as we’re already seeing happen—we believe our leading customerexperiences, relentless invention, customer focus, and hard work will result in significant growth in thecoming years. And, of course, this doesn’t include the other businesses and experiences we’re pursuing atAmazon, all of which are still in their early days.\\nI strongly believe that our best days are in front of us, and I look forward to working with my teammates at\\nAmazon to make it so.\\nSincerely,\\nAndy Jassy\\nPresident and Chief Executive OfficerAmazon.com, Inc.\\nP .S. As we have always done, our original 1997 Shareholder Letter follows. What’s written there is as true\\ntoday as it was in 1997.', metadata={'source': 'https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2023/ar/2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'page': 6}), Document(page_content='1997 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS\\n(Reprinted from the 1997 Annual Report)\\nTo our shareholders:\\nAmazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers,\\nyielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressivecompetitive entry.\\nBut this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves\\ncustomers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate thevery process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so,hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.\\nWe have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity\\nand as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitivelandscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offeringsand have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to movequickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunitiesin other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not withoutrisk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.\\nIt’s All About the Long Term\\nWe believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long\\nterm. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position.\\nThe stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translatedirectly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns oninvested capital.\\nOur decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most\\nindicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue topurchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to investaggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish anenduring franchise.\\nBecause of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than\\nsome companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-makingapproach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:\\n• We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers.• We will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations\\nrather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions.\\n• We will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically, to\\njettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to step up our investment in those that workbest. We will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures.', metadata={'source': 'https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2023/ar/2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'page': 7}), Document(page_content='• We will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of\\ngaining market leadership advantages. Some of these investments will pay off, others will not, and wewill have learned another valuable lesson in either case.\\n• When forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our GAAP accounting and maximizing\\nthe present value of future cash flows, we’ll take the cash flows.\\n• We will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices (to the extent\\ncompetitive pressures allow), so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rationallong-term leadership investments.\\n• We will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture. We understand the importance of\\ncontinually reinforcing a cost-conscious culture, particularly in a business incurring net losses.\\n• We will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long-term profitability and capital management.\\nAt this stage, we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving thepotential of our business model.\\n• We will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees, and continue to\\nweight their compensation to stock options rather than cash. We know our success will be largelyaffected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like,and therefore must actually be, an owner.\\nWe aren’t so bold as to claim that the above is the “right” investment philosophy, but it’s ours, and we\\nwould be remiss if we weren’t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.\\nWith this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our\\noutlook for the future.\\nObsess Over Customers\\nFrom the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the\\nWeb was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simplycould not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection thanwas possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a doggedfocus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offercustomers gift certificates, 1-Click\\nSMshopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and\\nrecommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouthremains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customershave placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leaderin online bookselling.\\nBy many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:\\n• Sales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million – an 838% increase.• Cumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 – a 738% increase.• The percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to\\nover 58% in the same period in 1997.\\n• In terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the\\ntop 20.\\n• We established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America\\nOnline, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.', metadata={'source': 'https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2023/ar/2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='Infrastructure\\nDuring 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased\\ntraffic, sales, and service levels:\\n• Amazon.com’s employee base grew from 158 to 614, and we significantly strengthened our\\nmanagement team.\\n• Distribution center capacity grew from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including a 70% expansion of our\\nSeattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in Delaware in November.\\n• Inventories rose to over 200,000 titles at year-end, enabling us to improve availability for our customers.• Our cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public offering in\\nMay 1997 and our $75 million loan, affording us substantial strategic flexibility.\\nOur Employees\\nThe past year’s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in\\nbeing a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, thesingle most important element of Amazon.com’s success.\\nIt’s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, “Y ou can work long, hard, or smart, but at\\nAmazon.com you can’t choose two out of three”), but we are working to build something important, somethingthat matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren’t meant tobe easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passionbuild Amazon.com.\\nGoals for 1998\\nWe are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet\\ncommerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base.This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience,selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time webelieve that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities tobetter serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience.To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but inprioritizing our investments.\\nWe now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have\\nso much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. Thechallenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several:aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks ofproduct and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding marketopportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove tobe a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good aboutwhat we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.\\n1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and\\ntrust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.\\nJeffrey P .
